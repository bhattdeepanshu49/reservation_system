# reservation_system
Created a javaBus Reservation System that allows users to check bus schedules, order tickets, cancel reser vations, and see the bus status board. In order for the system to show seat availability and passenger names,  users must enter the bus number. The quantity of tickets, seat numbers, and passenger names can then be  entered by users.
